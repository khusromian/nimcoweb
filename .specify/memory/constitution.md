# Simple Single-Page Food Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### Simplicity
All design and functionality must prioritize simplicity. User interfaces should be clean and uncluttered, with minimal cognitive load required to navigate and understand the content. Features should be added only when they provide clear value without complicating the user experience.

### Clarity
All product information must be presented clearly with simple English language. Product names and descriptions should be straightforward and immediately understandable. Visual hierarchy should guide users naturally to important information and calls-to-action.

### Accessibility
The website must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and responsive design that works across all devices and screen sizes.

## Constraints

### Language Requirements
All content must be in simple English that is easily understood by a general audience. Technical jargon should be avoided in favor of clear, everyday language.

### Design Standards
The design must remain clean and lightweight with minimal external dependencies. Page loading times should be optimized and visual elements should support the content rather than distract from it.

### Platform Compatibility
The website must be fully responsive and function properly on both mobile and desktop devices. Single-page scroll navigation should be smooth and intuitive.

## Development Workflow

### Product Presentation
Products (Juice, Biscuit, Nimco) must be prominently displayed with clear visual representation, simple descriptions, and visible calls-to-action. Each product section should be easily scannable and accessible from the main page.

### Testing Requirements
All changes must be tested on multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent experience. Performance testing should verify that page load times remain fast and the site remains responsive.

### Deployment Standards
The website should maintain high availability with proper error handling. Changes should be deployed with minimal downtime and include rollback capabilities.

## Governance

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles that guide all development decisions for the food website. All features, design choices, and technical implementations must align with these principles. Any proposed changes that conflict with these principles require explicit justification and approval.
