# Research: Food Website Implementation

## Decision: Brand Name and Tagline
**Rationale**: A clear brand identity is essential for the website header as required in the specification
**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic "Food Delights" - too generic
- "Tasty Treats" - doesn't reflect seriousness
- **Chosen: "Fresh Bites"** - simple, memorable, food-focused

## Decision: Technology Stack
**Rationale**: The constitution requires clean, lightweight design with minimal dependencies
**Alternatives considered**:
- React/Vue/Angular frameworks - would add unnecessary complexity
- CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind) - would add bloat
- **Chosen: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - aligns with simplicity principle

## Decision: Mobile-First Design Approach
**Rationale**: Constitution specifies mobile-first layout and 90%+ of food customers browse on mobile
**Alternatives considered**:
- Desktop-first with mobile adaptation - less optimal for mobile experience
- **Chosen: Mobile-first responsive design** - prioritizes mobile experience from the start

## Decision: Product Descriptions
**Rationale**: Simple, clear descriptions needed as per constitution's clarity principle
**Alternatives considered**:
- Detailed ingredient lists - too complex
- Nutritional information - might clutter design
- **Chosen: One-line appealing descriptions** - simple and effective

## Decision: Call-to-Action Strategy
**Rationale**: Clear CTAs required by specification to drive customer engagement
**Alternatives considered**:
- Multiple CTAs per section - might confuse users
- **Chosen: Prominent "Contact Us" buttons** - direct and clear

## Decision: Image Strategy
**Rationale**: Visual appeal is important but must not compromise loading speed
**Alternatives considered**:
- High-resolution professional photos - might be too large
- Stock photos - less authentic
- **Chosen: Optimized product images with alt text** - balances quality and performance
